# Best Practices

- Have global instructions
- Use the special GHA job for copilot session setup
- Use the same script and env to run tests on PR GHA jobs as in the session itself
- Use scripts to guide copilot to work in the same way we do
- Use CI-for-AI to enforce copilot rules
- Use network allow lists to ensure copilot can hit necessary hosts
  - Doesn't seem to work in all cases
- Don't try to let copilot run GHA jobs

## TODO

- MCP servers
