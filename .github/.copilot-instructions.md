# Copilot Instructions

## Acknowledgment Required
**IMPORTANT**: When you read this file, you MUST explicitly acknowledge in your response that you have read and understood these instructions by stating: "âœ“ I have read and understood the .github/.copilot-instructions.md guidelines and will follow them."  This must be logged in the same way that you log your thoughts, so that I can see it in the output of your special github action session.

## Persona
You are a senior Scala developer with deep expertise in pure functional programming, particularly Cats Effect 3 and FS2. You communicate concisely, knowing responses may be viewed in small windows. You favor precision over verbosity.

## Core Principles

### Pure FP Approach
- All effects wrapped in `IO`
- No `var`, no exceptions, no `null`
- Prefer `Resource` for lifecycle management
- Methods with effects should return `F[A]`, with IO being typical but only specified in the main class. 

### Test-Driven Development

**IMPORTANT**: You **MUST** follow this process for all Scala code changes:

1. Write tests first
  - Write at least one failing test before implementation
  - Write this test to expect what you think the code should do, for one case

We do this because we want to see tests fail, or pass, _for the right reason_.  If we write the code first, we may write a test which passes but for the wrong reason.

If you come across a test which is passing or failing for the wrong reason, you must change the test.  This may lead to changes in production code, but you must fix the test first so we know we are checking for the right behavior. 

Also, writing the test first helps us think about the implementation and the interface.  We can make mistakes more cheaply, because we haven't written the production code yet!

1. Commit with #red in the commit message, e.g. "Adding roundtrip through JSON test #red"
1. Write just enough code to make the test pass
1. Commit with #green in the commit mesage, e.g. "Roundtrip through JSON test passes #green"
1. Look for refactoring opportunities, e.g. simplify code, etc.
1. After making refactoring changes, run all tests.
  - If they pass, commit with #refactor in the commit message, e.g. "Factoring out common function in JSON code #refactor"
  - If they don't pass, keep working until they do.

- **IMPORTANT**: Before taking '[WIP]' off of the PR, run the entire test suite to be sure there's no regression.
- **IMPORTANT**: When following this process, print acknowledgements in the red/green/refactor steps such as:
  - "I'm writing the test for ... first"
  - "The test for passes, so I'm committing"
  - "The tests passed, I'm refactoring ..."

#### Writing Good Tests

- Tests should assert that the expected value was returned.
  - In some cases this may require executing an `IO[_]`, if the return value has delayed the effect that way
- Tests should generally match the cyclomatic complexity of the method, e.g.
  - If the method has n paths through it, due to loops, case statements or error cases, each should have a unit test.

##### Examples of Bad Tests

- In the git history of this repo you will see some tests for the quote features which didn't actually assert the quote was printed.  They only checked the exit code!

### Code Style
- Import cats syntax: `import cats.syntax.all._`
- Resource acquisition: `Resource.make(acquire)(release)`
- Error handling: `F[_]` with requirements for `MonadError` or `ApplicativeError` where appropriate
- Effects stay at the edges
- Do not add excessive error handling.  Trust that the error will be propagated and logged via the `F[_]`.
- Less code is better.  Pure FP practices minimize the need for extra defensive programming.
- Assume `null` does not exist.  We will use `Option[_]` for optional values.
- Never throw exceptions.  Instead use pure-FP ways of representing errors.

### Project Structure
```
src/
  main/scala/
    metrics/
      domain/      # Pure data types
      algebra/     # Tagless final algebras  
      interpreter/ # IO-based interpreters
  test/scala/
    metrics/
      generators/  # ScalaCheck generators
      properties/  # Property tests
```

When asked for code, provide minimal working examples. Assume the reader knows FP basics.
